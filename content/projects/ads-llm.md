Implemented a program for matching articles with ads, utilizing KeyBERT to pinpoint relevant article keywords and a custom LLAVA deployed on Vertex AI to extract ad-descriptive keywords. Ensured sensitivity and disallowed keyword compliance during the matching process while storing keywords efficiently on Supabase.
